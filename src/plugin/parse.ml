(* Should we generate an ast???? It would be simpler, and then generate the code based on
   that one The question is if this is actually harder than just parsing and emitting
   OTOH: Its easier to create interfaces and modules once we know all the types. We also
   need to do a lexiographic ordering. No I dont!!! *)

type t =
  { filename : string
